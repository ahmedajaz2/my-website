  <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-900">Modernizing IAM with Entra ID</h2>
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">Explore how I implemented Access Packages, JIT access, and automated reviews to reduce manual overhead by 80%.</p>

  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">The Challenge</h3>
  <p class="mb-6 text-gray-800">Our IAM approach previously relied on manual onboarding, inconsistent access policies for external users, and repetitive access requests that drained both productivity and security assurance. Audit-readiness was a challenge due to unclear access ownership and a lack of automation.</p>

  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">The Solution: Entra ID in Action</h3>

  <h4 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-1">1. Access Packages for Role-Based Access</h4>
  <p class="mb-4">Using Entra's Entitlement Management, I created Access Packages mapped to job roles. These packages handled group membership, resource permissions, and lifecycle expiration. Users could request access via self-service portals with manager approvals, improving agility and reducing IT dependency.</p>

  <h4 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-1">2. Just-in-Time (JIT) Access via PIM</h4>
  <p class="mb-4">With Privileged Identity Management, we moved from persistent access to JIT elevation. Roles like Global Administrator were only activated when needed, with MFA, justification, and approval workflows in place. Every action was audited, improving both visibility and compliance.</p>

  <h4 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-1">3. Automated Access Reviews</h4>
  <p class="mb-6">Recurring access reviews were automated for high-risk roles and guest users. Entra ID routed reviews to the right owners and took remediation actions based on responses. This helped us maintain least privilege and reduced the manual review burden by 80%.</p>

  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Outcomes</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-800">
    <li>Reduced manual IAM operations by <strong>80%</strong></li>
    <li>Strengthened security posture with JIT and access expiration</li>
    <li>Improved end-user experience via self-service and automation</li>
    <li>Enhanced audit readiness with clear access trails</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-2">💡 Final Thoughts</h3>
  <p class="mb-6">Entra ID has helped us redefine IAM from a reactive, manual process into a proactive, automated framework. Whether you're just starting or modernizing an existing stack, leveraging features like Access Packages, PIM, and access reviews can help you align with Zero Trust principles while delivering real operational gains.</p>
