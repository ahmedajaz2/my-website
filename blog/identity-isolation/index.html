  <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
    Learn how I led seamless Microsoft Entra ID tenant and Azure subscription migrations for global production environments‚Äîachieving 99.9% uptime, secure identity isolation, and zero downtime.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">The Challenge</h3>
  <p class="mb-6 text-gray-800">
    As enterprises scale globally, tenant migrations and subscription reorganizations become critical. Our environment involved live workloads, cross-geo compliance requirements, and sensitive user data spread across multiple hybrid tenants. We needed to ensure secure identity isolation, maintain 99.9% availability, and deliver without business disruption.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Strategic Solution</h3>

  <h4 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-1">1. Entra ID Tenant Migrations</h4>
  <p class="mb-4">
    I partnered with engineering teams to plan and execute Microsoft Entra ID tenant migrations. The strategy focused on secure app re-registration, user re-provisioning, and domain cut-over with full retention of conditional access, identity protection, and group policies.
  </p>

  <h4 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-1">2. Subscription & Resource Migration</h4>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Migrated production subscriptions across tenant boundaries while preserving access controls and policy enforcement. All movement was mapped against compliance zones, with RBAC configurations and blueprint baselines validated post-migration.
  </p>

  <h4 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-1">3. Automation and Dashboards</h4>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Automated 80% of the migration steps using PowerShell, Python, and KQL scripts‚Äîreducing cutover time by 30+ hours. I developed Power BI dashboards for leadership, showing real-time progress across regions and tenants.
  </p>

  <h4 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-1">4. Incident Response and IAM Hygiene</h4>
  <p class="mb-6">
    Established a dedicated IAM response team to monitor issues in real-time, enabling rapid rollbacks and ensuring MTTR was reduced by over 80% in the event of anomalies or performance drops.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Outcomes</h3>
